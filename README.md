# SurveyApp
 SurveyApp created with Flutter and Dart
I used different kind of technologies in this project:
- Firebase Auth
- Firebase Cloud
- Firebase Firestore
- GetIt
- Shared Preferences
- Google Fonts
- Hand Signature
- Image Compressing
- Image Picker
- Email Validator

Features:
- User can register with his email to survey application.
- In this app, user can upload a profile photo from camera or gallery. 
- User must provide signature at the end of each survey.
- All survey data can be shown my Admin users in different panel (in app).
- User can see his/her previous answers on each survey.
- On database, with the image convertion and compressing methods, all signatures stored for admins.
- Several technologies like getIt and sharedprefences used for cleaner code.

  (IMPORTANT NOTE) This application is just for learning and practicing Flutter and Dart. One of my first practice projects.
